## Projects and Research
Here are some of the projects that  i have worked on during my M.Sc 




### 1. Incorporating Active learning Methods with Contextualized Sentence Representations 
Final project in NLP class, Tel Aviv Univesity 2019. Together with Danielle Hausler.
An empirical comparison study on two different sentence representations (SentenceBert and Best-as-Service ) which utilize BERT contextualized word representations. We implement several Active learning methods and compare their performances on different types of text Datasets and tasks. Until submission date (May 2020) There where almost no papers that deals with "Bertology" and Active learning. [Github repository](https://github.com/daniellehausler/nlp_active_learning)  and the (unpublished) [Paper](https://github.com/katzurik/katzurik.github.io/blob/main/NLP_katz_hausler.pdf)

### 2. Besov smoothness analysis on Deep learning Text classifier With different Word Representations
Final project in Mathematical foundations of machine learning class, Tel Aviv Univesity 2019. Together with Danielle Hausler.
We used [this method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03263) to quantify the geometry of the clustering within each layer representation using the Besov index of smoothness.
We have shown that the Besov smoothness increase from layer to layer inside the model architecture. We have compared different word representations (One-hot-encoding and FastText with/without max pooling) and showed that the Besov smoothness indeed increases as a function of the goodness of representation.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/katzurik/katzurik.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
